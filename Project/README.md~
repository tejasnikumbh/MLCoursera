Introduction : - 
***************
    This course project aims at building a convolutional network for digit recognition.The
project primarily involves implementing a convolutional neural network which involves the
use of backpropagation algorithm in order to train and build a digit recognition system.The
system would use the feed forward neural network architecture.It uses fminunc to minimize the
error w.r.t the weights and find the optimized values for the weights.This project is implem
-ented in c++ 4.7, and prototyped in GNU Octave 3.6+.

Prime Components : -
*******************

    Following are the prime components/blocks which would help build the neural network program.

  Abstraction for the Neural Network Architecture
  -----------------------------------------------
     A framework for building the Convolutional Neural Network. This framework/workbench makes use
of the following abstractions.

  1. The NeuralNetwork Class
       This class acts as an interface for the constructing program that constructs the
     convolutional neural network. It consists of the components listed below.
  2. The NNLayer Class
       Models the concept of a layer in the neural network. 
  3. The NNNeuron Class
       Models the concept of a neuron in the neural network.
  4. The NNConnection Class
       Models the concept of a connection in the neural network.
  5. The NNWeight Class.
       Models the concept of a weight in the neural network.

    A seperate concept/class for a Neural Network weight is necessary because in the specific
program for training a "Convolutional Neural Network", many weights are shared across connections,
hence the abstraction helps add simplicity to code.
    Also, this specific abstraction of a feed forward neural network is wired to help train 
the convolutional neural network, hence it may not generalize well to other neural network training
methods.

  Program for constructing convolution network
  ---------------------------------------------
    This program named ConvolutionNetwork.cpp constructs the convolutional neural network using
the Neural Network Architecture abstraction specified above. It initialises the network to have
random weights.

  Program for training the convolution network
  ---------------------------------------------
    This program trains the convolution network using backpropogation algorithm to calculate the
errors w.r.t the weights and fminunc to optimize the weight values so that these errors are minim
ized. We take the help of an external library(containing fminunc) to minimize error.

  Test program for the convolution network
  -----------------------------------------
    This program helps test the trained convolutional neural network using the above main program.

  Data for testing and training purposes
  ---------------------------------------
    The project uses the MNIST database for recognition of handwritten digits as found on Professor
Yann Lecun's website to train and test the Convolutional Neural Network.
